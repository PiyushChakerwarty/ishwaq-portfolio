                        I am a hard-working individual who is very self-aware and willing to push myself out of my comfort zone. I work effectively within a group and independently. I feel that punctuality and reliability are important priorities for me in any role I am given. I have great problem-solving skills and can use my initiative to solve any issues that may arise when working. Furthermore, my experience in working in a fast-paced retail and food hospitality job has enabled me to improve my personal skills. This is due to the fact that I have reflected on what I have learnt in all the roles I have undertaken and what I can improve on. This has allowed me to pay attention to details and reduce the chance of mistakes that can arise as a result of being put under pressure.

            <h1>Week 7 Reflection</h1>
            <br>
            <h2>Developing Digital Identity</h2>
            <p>In today's lesson I have learnt about 'usability' and how important this function is when it comes to creating my own digital artefact as well as making it easy and quick for clients to access the website. My lecturer has gone through PowerPoint slides giving us guidelines on what to do and don't when creating a website including how to create a good homepage he also went through some examples of good homepages we could use as an idea when making a website. Furthermore I have been taught four principles of graphics design which include; alignment proximity repetition and contrast.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Information Systems Databases</h2>
            <p>Today I have learn to retrieve data from multiple tables in oracle SQL by using various of connections like 'Left Outer' 'Right Outer' inner and 'Full Outer.' I also explored subqueries for combining multiple SELECT statements improving data manipulation abilities. In addition 'SET' operations like 'UNION' 'INTERSECT' and 'MINUS' were calculated for merging and comparing datasets. Generally speaking learning about this today has has expanded my knowledge learning about these important functions in SQL as well as equipping me with how to deal with complex data scenarios for the future when i encounter dealing with this type of data in SQL.</p>

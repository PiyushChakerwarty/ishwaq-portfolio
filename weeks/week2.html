            <br>
            <h2>Developing Digital Identity</h2>
            <p>The teacher had discussed with the class about the similarities between CSS and HTML and what each
                feature does in the digital world. I have also learnt how to describe the use several types of CSS
                selectors: Type ID class. During the lesson I was able to use a tool to edit HTML and CSS files.
                Also I was able to test a HTML document that was already stored in the computer by loading it into a
                browser. After I have done that I then proceeded to validate the documents by using a website called
                'W3C Markup' validation which was helpful. I really enjoyed my first lesson learning about these basic
                things for when I create my own website.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Information Systems Databases</h2>
            <p>I have learnt about the function of the ER (entity relational) modelling and understood purpose of using
                it. I was able to identify the use of entities and their attributes for a small case study during the
                lecture lesson. One of things I have learnt included Distinguishing one to one one too many to many
                relationships as well as studying diagrams and understanding the concept of it. I also learnt how to how
                to decompose many to many relationships and how to break it down bit by bit.
                I have also created an entity diagram for a small case study so I can practice and be good at it. Lastly
                the lesson has been great and learnt interesting things.</p>

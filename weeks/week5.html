            <br>
            <h2>Developing Digital Identity</h2>
            <p>In today's lecture I have learnt how to use pseudo code in HTML&CSS as well as the pseudo element selector. It was interesting to learning about it and how to change colours and fonts using these techniques on W3School website. I have accessed the lec5.zip file which the teacher set us a task to change some elements on the website to edit text writings and changing the fonts and colours. I also used W3schools to help me with the task. In addition i have enjoyed playing around with these techniques and can't wait to apply this when I'm going to be creating my own website.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Information Systems Databases</h2>
            <p>Reflecting on today's lesson I have started learning about a new topic which is called 'SQL' which is part of the databases that I am currently learning about. I was able to create my own APEX Oracle account to create database objects set by my lecturer. It was interesting using APEX as well as learning about 'select statement' and how it's used to retrieve data also various of arithmetic functions to use in query when dealing with data in table format that can be quite difficult to manage. In addition I was able to create my own queries using my APEX account and learnt about some of the SQL functions on APEX.</p>

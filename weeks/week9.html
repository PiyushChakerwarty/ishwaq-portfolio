            <h2>Developing Digital Identity</h2>
            <p>The lesson today has been interesting. I learnt how to create unordered list in HTML using the
            and tags as well as arranging content proficiently. In CSS formatting specifically aligning list
                    items was explored to improve visual appeal and readability to web clients. In addition I have
                    understood and learnt about CSS properties such as list-style type which allowed me to modify texts
                    and bullet points creating more consistent design when creating my website. Moreover I noticed that
                    placeholders were presented as links enabling navigation within the same page throughout anchor
                    tags. This lesson has taught me the significance of using suitable structured code enhancing user
                    experience and accessibility on the website.</p>

                    <h2>Information Systems Databases</h2>
                    <p>Today I have studied the basics of database transaction and how they are like packages of tasks
                        that has to be complete together to maintain steadiness. I learnt about SQL commands and some of
                        the functions such as 'COMMIT' and 'ROLLBACK' and how to handle them. Also I learnt about
                        transaction logs and track changes and how vital it is for aiding recovery when needed. It was
                        interesting learning about how locks controls access to data items as well as how concurrency
                        controls and manages several users retrieving the database simultaneously. This helped me
                        understand the fundamentals of maintaining data integrity and safeguarding smooth operation of
                        the database system.</p>

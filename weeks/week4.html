            <br>
            <h2>Developing Digital Identity</h2>
            <p>In today's lesson the lecturer has taught me about the fundamental concepts of CSS and gaining insights
                into various aspects of styling web pages. Some of the key points I learnt from today's lecture is
                normalize.css style sheet and how it works by normalizing browser and ensuring stability throughout
                different browsers. This is executed by providing a steady baseline for styling it makes the development
                process simpler and improves the user experience by minimizing rendering inconsistencies. I also learnt
                about the differences between absolute vs. relative units and how important it is understanding how the
                elements are positioned and sizes in CSS. Absolute unit provides fixed sizes and relative unit provides
                adaptability and flexibility with different devices and screen sizes.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Information Systems Databases</h2>
            <p>Today's session was really fascinating as i have learnt about various of aspects on database design and
                entity relationships. My lecturer has taught us about recursive entity relationships and how the
                databases are interconnected based on this. Also another important thing i was taught about is 'mutually
                exclusive relationships' in database and have drawn a diagram to help me understand the purpose of this.
                I was also able to identify and draw 'subtype' and 'supertype' and understanding how important it is in
                database system and how it is linked to entities. I was able to identify and solve common connection
                traps in ER diagram.</p>

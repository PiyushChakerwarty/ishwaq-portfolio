            <h2>Developing Digital Identity</h2>
            <p>In today's lecture I have learnt about the CSS box model and how it's used when creating a website. I find it fascinating how the CSS box model is used to create the layout and spacing of HTML elements. the teacher has shown us a tutorial of how to change text elements and adding shadows and special effects to it by using CSS style. I have also practiced how to change the fonts and the style of texts by using W3School  i did this so i can understand it better and apply that when i will be going to create my own website.</p>

            <h2>Information Systems Databases</h2>
            <p>My lecture today has been interesting as i have learnt about SQL queries discovering various functions and clauses to improve data manipulation and retrieval. i started off by using selected character functions such as 'SUBSTR' and 'CONCAT' to abstract and concatenate strings within the queries offering more flexibility in handling text data. Also I have experimented with date functions in order to manipulate date formats and date fields according to precise criteria. Furthermore I have encountered values such as 'NULL' inside my dataset and learnt how to manage them effectively using the function 'NVL'. Overall today's lesson has been really interesting and enjoyed learning about SQL functions.</p>

            <br>
            <h2>Developing Digital Identity</h2>
            <p>During the lecture lesson I was able explain what HTML5 semantic elements consists of such as header
                section main article footer aside and most importantly figure. Also I learnt about the guideline of
                using meta to create my own website by the of this module as well as the attribute of the
                tag which contains; charset name and content and how vital it is for when creating a website. The
                teacher went through the assignment brief with us during seminar to give us a detailed explanation about
                the assignment requirements ensuring clarity for the tasks ahead that I will doing when creating my own
                web project.

            <h2>Information Systems Databases</h2>
            <p>In today's lesson the teacher has taught us about the concepts of normalisation functional dependency
                diagrams and denormalization. I have learnt how important normalization is as it helps minimize
                inconsistency and redundancy in data making sure data integrity and making the data base more efficient.
                In addition one of the things i learnt is how functional dependency is linked between attributes in
                relation whereas one attribute uniquely regulates another. One of the things i have also learnt about is
                denormalization and how it involves deliberately introducing redundancy for presentation by optimization
                of querying. After the lesson I have drawn a functional dependency diagram to get better understanding
                of it.</p>

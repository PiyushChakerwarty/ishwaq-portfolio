            <h1>Week 8 Reflection</h1>
            <br>
            <h2>Developing Digital Identity</h2>
            <p>Reflecting on today's lesson my lecturer has taught us about how to use normalize.css sheet when it comes to creating our own websites and the importance of it. I have been taught how to use the normaalized.css sheet when creating a website and how it provides consistent styles across all various web browsers by readjusting default styles applied by browsers to HTML elements. Furthermore i have learnt about the 'float' element and how it is used to align elements horizontally within the box. I have also learnt about the codes you use to do the float element when creating my own website. I have used the W3school to experiment with some of the features that im going to be using for when i create my own website.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Information Systems Databases</h2>
            <p>Today's lesson has been interesting as i have studied about essential aspects of database management. I learnt how to make and delete tables adding constraints to make sure data integrity. This included amending tables which allows for structural modification as needed as well as understanding data manipulation commands such as inserting updating and deleting data which is important for managing information within table content. I have also explored virtual representation of data dealing with complicated queries whilst managing good security level by monitoring access to certain information. Lastly today's lecture has taught me the foundational skills about managing database and emphasising the importance of organisation integrity and accessibility in handling data.</p>

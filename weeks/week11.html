            <h2>Developing Digital Identity</h2>
            <p>The lesson today has been great. I have learnt about 'Responsive Web Design' which comprises of 3 important essential components which are media queries flexible grids and fluid images. I learnt that embracing fluid layouts offers multiple benefits as well as enabling seamless adaptations to numerous devices and screen sizes. Learning about these functions for converting pixels into percentages and empowering effective implementation of fluid layouts in HTML and CSS by ensuring receptiveness across all devices. In addition I looked at scalable images inside the fluid layouts and highlighting the importance of enhancing visuals for different types of screens. Lastly mastering these techniques have helped me greatly when making my own website.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Information Systems Databases</h2>
            <p>During my lecture today in information systems and database module I have delved deep into database management systems exploring what they can do and its constraints. Also I gained understandings into limitations of Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) and immediately began grasping the concepts NoSQL databases which helped me understand the database alternatives. Furthermore I have explored database warehouse and what they do in database which are like very organised storage units for large amount of data. One thing I also learnt was that different types of information systems such as transaction processing systems and decision support systems each one of these serving specific purposes. Overall the lesson has been really interesting and an eye opener learning about how important these functions are in database and information systems.</p>

            <h2>Developing Digital Identity</h2>
            <p>During the lecture I have been introduced to coding anchor elements inside an unordered list to produce a
                vertical navigation menu for when creating a website. I have been taught the elements are nested inside
                the elements when it comes to linking other pages within the websites. In addition the unordered
                    list is encapsulated inside the element with the 'id attribute' set to “nav menu”. Additionally
                        CSS formatting focuses on this id for tailoring the navigation menu. There is also a class
                        attribute called 'current' which is applied to the third item to imply the operating page. This
                        class value be applied to CSS to modify the formatting for that precise element. Overall it was
                        interesting learning about these things.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Information Systems Databases</h2>
            <p>Today's learning experience has been interesting I have learnt about the paramount importance of database
                security and integrity. This helped me understand how important these aspects are and also how it must
                be integrated into the database design and how important it is to regularly revisit the ongoing
                commitment that is needed to safeguard the data. I have also explored multiple features provided by
                Database Management Systems (DBMS) including admission controllers and auditing capabilities which
                underscored their vital role in supporting data integrity. Sometimes this can be concerning as it need
                to manage access by users to alleviate possible risks as well as making sure the database is secure as
                possible.</p>

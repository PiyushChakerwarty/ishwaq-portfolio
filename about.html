            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>My name is Ishwaq and I'm a 23-year-old student deeply passionate about studying information technology
                and have aspirations to work in the tech industry.</p>
                <br>
            <p>I find great joy in going on adventures, whether it's traveling, hiking, or simply exploring new
                sceneries. When I'm not out exploring, I enjoy reading books, finding comfort and inspiration within
                stories. I enjoy staying healthy and active which is important to me, so I make it a priority to go to
                the gym on a regular basis.</p>
                <br>
            <p>Above all, in my spare time I enjoy spending quality time with my family and friends. Surrounding myself
                with my family and friends' presence brings me joy and fulfillment, grounding me during life's
                adventures. In essence, I'm someone who seeks to balance academic curiosity with physical activity and
                meaningful relationships. It's through this balance that I hope to sculpt out my path in the world,
                leaving a positive impact on those around me while following my dreams in working in the tech industry.
